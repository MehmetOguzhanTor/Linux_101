## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning and exploring Linux, specifically using Ubuntu Server. Each step taken and project undertaken is recorded here to track progress and share knowledge. I have a second laptop that I don't use. I wanted to use it as a Linux Server.
